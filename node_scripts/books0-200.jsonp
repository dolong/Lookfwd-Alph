As she tries to piece together her life from before, she realizes it's one she no longer wants any part of. The old Sam took \"mean girl\" to a whole new level, and it's clear she and Cassie were more like best enemies. Sam is pretty sure that losing her memories is like winning the lottery.

All Sam wants is the truth, and if she can unlock her clouded memories of that fateful night, she can finally move on. But what if <I style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">not</I> remembering is the only thing keeping Sam alive?"

Six months can feel like a just couple of weeks when you’ve been away in another realm. Literally. Now that Darian is back in Seattle, she’s ready to face the life—and the man—she left behind. But it’s not going to be easy when a ghost from her past shows up looking to wreak havoc on Seattle’s supernatural crime scene. Darian isn’t as careless as she used to be, though. She and Tyler, her sexy Jinn protector, have come a long way in the trust department. And it’s a good thing too—because when Ty contracts her to assassinate a wickedly powerful supernatural who goes by the name of Mithras, it will take all her faith in Ty, and herself, to get the job done. While Darian does whatever it takes to get to her mark, Xander, the Shaede King is busy making plans of his own. With Darian’s attention divided between Lorik’s secrets and her mission she might not be able to stop Xander from doing anything in his power to separate Darian from her sworn protector and in the process, destroy his own kingdom…"

Now, saddled with a powerful, amoral entity willing to do anything to win his freedom, Isa must fight to keep her Living Tattoo from consuming her completely...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Praise for the novels of Marcella Burnard:<br /><br /><br /><br />“A huge hit!”—Night Owl Reviews<br /><br /><br /><br />“Thrilling!”—<i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Susan Kearney<br /><br /><br /><br />*<i>RT Book Reviews</i></b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Marcella Burnard</b> graduated from Cornish College of the Arts with the ever-practical degree in acting. She promptly made more money as a musician than as an actor, so it made sense that she switched to writing fiction for Berkley. Her first book, <i>Enemy Within</i>, won the Romantic Times Reviewer’s Choice award for Best Futuristic of 2010. The second book in the series, <i>Enemy Games</i>, released in 2011 followed by the novella, <i>Enemy Mine</i>, set in the same world in 2012. She currently lives with her husband and their cats aboard a sailboat on Puget Sound, and writes full time.<br /><br /><br /> <br />"

Now he explores new dimensions of time and space in <I>The Burning Dark.</I><BR><BR>Back in the day, Captain Abraham Idaho Cleveland had led the Fleet into battle against an implacable machine intelligence capable of devouring entire worlds. But after saving a planet, and getting a bum robot knee in the process, he finds himself relegated to one of the most remote backwaters in Fleetspace to oversee the decommissioning of a semi-deserted space station well past its use-by date.<BR><BR>But all is not well aboard the U-Star <I>Coast City.</I> The station’s reclusive Commandant is nowhere to be seen, leaving Cleveland to deal with a hostile crew on his own. Persistent malfunctions plague the station’s systems while interference from a toxic purple star makes even ordinary communications problematic. Alien shadows and whispers seem to haunt the lonely corridors and airlocks, fraying the nerves of everyone aboard.<BR><BR>Isolated and friendless, Cleveland reaches out to the universe via an old-fashioned space radio, only to tune in to a strange, enigmatic signal: a woman’s voice that seems to echo across a thousand light-years of space. But is the transmission just a random bit of static from the past—or a warning of an undying menace beyond mortal comprehension?<BR><BR>\"Builds tension expertly. Claustrophobic in mood but with the scope of great space opera, this is SF you will want to read with the light on.\"—<I>Library Journal, </I>starred review, on <I>The Burning Dark</I>"

"Desc" : "<div><b>She won’t be ruled again</b><br>  <br> Rosa Alban has been obedient her entire life. But when her alpha husband dies, she seizes the opportunity to flee the oppressive Guardiansthe rulers of the secret shapeshifter world. Her flight instantly brands her as a pack traitor, and she has no choice but to seek protection from a neighboring tribe by marrying one of their sons.<br>  <br> Known as the Beast of Merin, Luc Black loyally plays the part of unwanted son and devoted brother. He realizes marrying Rosa will strengthen his tribe’s territory, but he has no intention of loving ever again. Still, he’s unprepared for the intense physical need the wild she-wolf awakens in him.<br>  <br> When the Guardians hone in on Rosa, Luc must fight to protect his new bride. And as war descends, the unlikely allies discover their destinies are irrevocably entwined<br></div>"

Glowing moths fall to the waves around her, and the sleek bodies of unseen fish glide against her submerged ankles. </P>The world is Stormwrack, a series of island nations with a variety of cultures and economies—and a language different from any Sophie has heard. </P>Sophie doesn't know it yet, but she has just stepped into the middle of a political firestorm, and a conspiracy that could destroy a world she has just discovered...her world, where everyone seems to know who she is, and where she is forbidden to stay. </P><P>But Sophie is stubborn, and smart, and refuses to be cast adrift by people who don’t know her and yet wish her gone. With the help of a sister she has never known, and a ship captain who would rather she had never arrived, she must navigate the shoals of the highly charged politics of Stormwrack, and win the right to decide for herself whether she stays in this wondrous world...or is doomed to exile, in <I>Child of a Hidden Sea </I>by A.M.

"Title" : "Written in My Own Heart's Blood: A Novel (Outlander)" 
"Desc" : "<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</b><br><br>In her now classic novel <i>Outlander, </i>Diana Gabaldon told the story of Claire Randall, an English ex-combat nurse who walks through a stone circle in the Scottish Highlands in 1946, and disappears . . . into 1743. The story unfolded from there in seven bestselling novels, and CNN has called it “a grand adventure written on a canvas that probes the heart, weighs the soul and measures the human spirit across [centuries].” Now the story continues in <i>Written in My Own Heart’s Blood</i>.<br>  <br> 1778: France declares war on Great Britain, the British army leaves Philadelphia, and George Washington’s troops leave Valley Forge in pursuit. At this moment, Jamie Fraser returns from a presumed watery grave to discover that his best friend has married his wife, his illegitimate son has discovered (to his horror) who his father really is, and his beloved nephew, Ian, wants to marry a Quaker. Meanwhile, Jamie’s wife, Claire, and his sister, Jenny, are busy picking up the pieces.<br>  <br> The Frasers can only be thankful that their daughter Brianna and her family are safe in twentieth-century Scotland. Or not. In fact, Brianna is  searching for her own son, who was kidnapped by a man determined to learn her family’s secrets. Her husband, Roger, has ventured into the past in search of the missing boy . . . never suspecting that the object of his quest has not left the present. Now, with Roger out of the way, the kidnapper can focus on his true target: Brianna herself.<br>  <br> <i>Written in My Own Heart’s Blood</i> is the brilliant next chapter in a masterpiece of the imagination unlike any other.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Written in My Own Heart’s Blood</i></b><br> <b><i> </i></b><br> “[<i>Written in My Own Heart’s Blood</i>] features all the passion and swashbuckling that fans of this historical fantasy series have come to expect.”<b>—<i>People</i></b><br>  <br> “With her Outlander series, Gabaldon . . . successfully [juggles] a sizable and captivating cast of characters; developing thrilling plotlines that borrow equally from adventure, history, and romance; and meticulously integrating a wealth of fascinating period details into the story without slowing down the pace. The result is a sprawling and enthralling saga that is guaranteed to keep readers up long past their bedtimes.”<b>—<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</b>"

"Desc" : "Darkly romantic and entirely enchanting, this reimagining of <I>The Nutcracker</I> from Claire Legrand brims with magic, love, and intrigue. <I>New York Times </I>bestselling author Marissa Meyer (<I>Cinder</I>) says “this is not your grandmother’s <I>Nutcracker</I> tale.”<BR><BR>After her mother is brutally murdered, seventeen-year-old Clara Stole is determined to find out what happened to her. Her father, a powerful man with little integrity, is a notorious New York City gang lord in the syndicate-turned-empire called Concordia. And he isn’t much help.<BR> <BR>But there is something even darker than Concordia’s corruption brewing under the surface of the city, something full of vengeance and magic, like the stories Clara’s godfather used to tell her when she was a little girl. Then her father is abducted and her little sister’s life is threatened, and Clara accidentally frees Nicholas from a statue that has been his prison for years. Nicholas is the rightful prince of Cane, a wintry kingdom that exists beyond the city Clara has known her whole life.<BR> <BR>When Nicholas and Clara journey together to Cane to retrieve her father, Clara encounters Anise, the queen of the faeries, who has ousted the royal family in favor of her own totalitarian, anti-human regime. Clara finds that this new world is not as foreign as she feared, but time is running out for her family, and there is only so much magic can do..."

"Desc" : "<p>Girl gone wild...</p> <p>College is supposed to be a time of discovery, but Danielle Vaughn never imagined it would be like this: Heightened senses, supernatural powers, and a sudden craving for human blood. Dani is a demi-vamp, the daughter of a human psychic and a vampire noble, a living secret kept hidden for 21 years.</p> <p>As Dani's heritage manifests itself, her thirst for blood is matched only by her hunger for Chase Diedrick. But as the son of the Vampire Council's most powerful ruling family, Chase is already promised to another. Dani saw Council politics destroy her mother's life; she won't let the same thing happen to her. Besides, there's no shortage of men who are eager to satisfy her every need, including the alluring vampire Kayden.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Dani also has no shortage of enemies. Her heightened powers of telepathy and telekinesis attract the attention of a rogue vamp who preys on gifted vampires, absorbing their skills along with their lifeblood. Now, Dani must seek the Council's help to quickly master her new vampire life...or risk losing it.</p>"

"Desc" : "A blazingly inventive near-future thriller from the best-selling, Hugo Award-winning John Scalzi.<BR><BR>Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent – and nearly five million souls in the United States alone – the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.<BR><BR>A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what’s now known as \"Haden’s syndrome,\" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" – someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time.　If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.<BR><BR>But \"complicated\" doesn’t begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery – and the real crime – is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture. It’s nothing you could have expected."

The only problem is, ever since waking up in a leaky cellar belonging to three-hundred-year-old vampire, Will Austen, she's been very much dead. And to make matters worse, she's since found that an aversion to blood and a fear of the dark aren't very helpful - especially when you're a fledgling vamp.<br /><br />William James Austen has fallen hard. He's spent the last year loving Ellie from afar and now he's finally able to be truthful about who and what he is. As the most powerful and revered vampire in London, he's used to getting what he wants.<br /><br />But this time, Will might just have bitten off more than he can chew.<br /><br />"

But she knows Nathan will eventually be called back to serve his queenand Kai will have to decide whether to enter her majesty’s service as well. Sure, the job comes with great bennies, but there’s one big downside: she would have to swear absolute fealty to the Queen of Winter.<br><br> For now, though, Kai is glad to be home, and glad that Nathan completed his mission for his queen with surprising ease. But what seemed to be a quick conclusion turns out to be anything but. The two of them helped thwart the sidhe god of chaosand he is not happy about that. He’s got plans for them. Plans, too, for the sidhe who killed him some three millennia ago. Nor has he abandoned his plans for Earth, as they learn when chaos begins bursting out all over...</div>"
